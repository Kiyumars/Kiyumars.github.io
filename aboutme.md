subtitle: Kiyumars likes to code and wear brown clothes

My name is Philip Kiyumars Maessoumi, and I work as a full stack developer. 

My preferred tech stack is a Golang backend, a simple React frontend, and an unobtrusive CSS framework like Spectre or bulma.

I also like to coach those who come from non-technical backgrounds to beginner programming / web dev concepts.

Another interest is creative writing. I am the main organizer of Shut Up and Write in Berlin, where we follow the pomodoro technique of having concentrated writing sessions with scheduled breaks.

And yes, I really do like brown. A close second is purple.
